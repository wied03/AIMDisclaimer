This is an old plugin that was written for AIM Triton.

It's written in C#.Net and exposed itself via COM/Interop

It's probably not of use to anyone, but it was kind of handy.

It basically allows you to configure a disclaimer message that is automatically sent out to buddies
in a configurable group at a configurable time interval.
